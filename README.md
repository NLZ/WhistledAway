# WhistledAway

WhistledAway adds a tooltip message to the Flight Master's Whistle and an icon on the map to indicate the nearest flight master.

NOTE: It's not possible to guarantee the nearest flight master, so take the indications with a bit of salt! Also, due to limitations in WoW, WhistledAway might indicate flight paths you have not yet unlocked.
